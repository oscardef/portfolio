## Context

Bloomberg is one of the world's most influential financial technology companies, building the infrastructure that powers global markets. Its systems process enormous volumes of real-time data and support mission-critical workflows for financial institutions, governments, and enterprises worldwide.

I will be joining Bloomberg's London engineering office for a six-month software engineering placement beginning in March 2026.

This role represents a natural continuation of my focus on **systems engineering, performance, and reliability**, and an opportunity to operate at a level of scale rarely encountered outside of top-tier infrastructure companies.

## What I'll Be Working On

While specific team details will be determined closer to the start date, Bloomberg engineers typically work on large-scale distributed systems responsible for:

- Real-time financial data processing  
- Low-latency backend services  
- Highly reliable infrastructure  
- Internal platforms supporting thousands of engineers  
- Data-intensive pipelines with strict availability requirements  

Given my background in systems, machine learning infrastructure, and performance-oriented engineering, I expect to contribute to projects involving scalable architecture, efficiency optimization, and production-grade software development.

## Why Bloomberg

Bloomberg stands out for its engineering-driven culture and long-term ownership mindset. Many of its core systems have been refined over decades, emphasizing stability, observability, and operational excellence.

I was particularly drawn to:

- The opportunity to build software that directly impacts global markets  
- A strong culture of technical rigor  
- Emphasis on reliability and performance  
- Exposure to complex distributed systems at scale  

## What I Aim to Gain

During this placement, I am especially excited to deepen my experience in:

- Designing and operating production systems  
- Writing software that must be correct, fast, and resilient  
- Navigating large, mature codebases  
- Collaborating within high-performing engineering teams  
- Making pragmatic engineering tradeoffs under real-world constraints  

## Looking Ahead

This internship marks an important step toward my long-term goal of becoming a systems-focused software engineer capable of building robust infrastructure and high-performance platforms.

I look forward to contributing meaningfully while learning from engineers operating at the forefront of financial technology.

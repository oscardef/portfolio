## Context

Researchable is a Groningen-based company building analytics tools for the academic research sector. I interned as a data scientist, working on their core data processing and analysis infrastructure.

## What I Did

- Built ETL pipelines for ingesting and processing academic publication metadata
- Developed ML models for predicting research impact and identifying trending topics
- Worked with PostgreSQL databases containing millions of publication records
- Created data visualization dashboards for internal stakeholders

## Impact

Delivered production-ready pipeline components and ML models integrated into the platform.

## What I Learned

- Practical data engineering skills — handling messy, real-world data at scale
- The gap between Jupyter notebook prototypes and production-ready code
- Working with domain experts (bibliometrics researchers) to translate business needs into technical solutions

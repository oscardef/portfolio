## Context

Securrency is a fintech company specializing in blockchain-based solutions for institutional finance — specifically the tokenization of securities (stocks, bonds, real estate) on distributed ledgers. I interned as a blockchain engineer during the summer of 2022.

## What I Did

- **Smart contract development:** Wrote and tested Solidity smart contracts implementing ERC-1400 (security token standard) for compliant tokenization of financial instruments
- **Backend services:** Built Node.js/TypeScript services for interacting with deployed contracts, monitoring transactions, and providing REST APIs for the frontend
- **Testing:** Comprehensive test suites using Hardhat for contract testing, including edge cases around transfer restrictions, compliance rules, and access control
- **Security review participation:** Assisted in internal security reviews of smart contracts, learning about common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, integer overflow, front-running)

## Impact

- Delivered smart contract implementations that passed internal security review
- Backend services integrated into the staging environment for client demonstrations
- Documentation I wrote was adopted as template for future intern onboarding

## What I Learned

- Smart contract development requires a different mindset — immutability means bugs are permanent and costly
- The intersection of finance and technology involves heavy regulatory compliance considerations
- Working in a fast-paced startup environment with direct access to senior engineers and founders
- First exposure to a professional engineering environment, which shaped my expectations for future roles

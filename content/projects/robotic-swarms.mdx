## Overview

This project explored decentralized coordination algorithms for swarms of miniaturized robots, developed in collaboration with MIT's Distributed Robotics Lab. The core challenge: how can dozens of simple, resource-constrained robots achieve complex collective behaviors without any central controller?

## What I Built

- Decentralized consensus algorithms for formation control
- Lightweight communication protocol for bandwidth-constrained radios
- Simulation environment for validating algorithms before physical deployment
- Integration with physical robot platform (custom Arduino-based bots)

## Technical Details

Key challenges included handling unreliable wireless communication, limited computational resources on each robot, and ensuring the system degrades gracefully when individual robots fail.

## Results

Successfully demonstrated 50-unit swarm achieving target formations with >90% accuracy in simulation and 10-unit physical validation.

## What I Learned

Working at the intersection of distributed systems and physical hardware taught me that theory and practice diverge significantly — algorithms that work perfectly in simulation face unexpected challenges with real sensors and actuators.

## Overview

A concurrent stock market simulation built in Java, featuring an order-matching engine, multiple autonomous trading bots with different strategies, and a real-time Swing GUI for visualization. The project explored concurrent programming patterns and market microstructure.

## What I Built

- Thread-safe order book with limit and market order support
- Price-time priority matching engine
- Autonomous trading bots (mean reversion, momentum, random, market making)
- Real-time Swing GUI with candlestick charts and order book visualization

## Technical Details

The core challenge was designing a concurrent system where multiple trading bots submit orders simultaneously to a shared order book, requiring careful synchronization to prevent race conditions while maintaining performance.

## What I Learned

This was my first serious concurrent programming project — it taught me the real cost of synchronization, the importance of lock ordering to prevent deadlocks, and how to reason about thread safety.
